    <h1>Amanda Adams CV</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>As an Information Security SME with 27+ years experience, I’ve been responsible and actively 
        involved in numerous roles including Team Management, partnering with Cloud Service Providers, 
        Regulatory Bodies, Security Associations, Vendors, and Executive Leaders. I am able to 
        communicate and articulate from the acutely technical, to the Executive/top table. I possess 
        deep technical knowledge in multiple areas which has enabled opportunities and responsibility 
        in Strategic Road maps, innovative solutions, threat modelling, complex problem solving, Governance, 
        critical analysis for threat impact, as well as working with other technical SMEs to drive 
        towards a common Goal. I consider myself a diverse Thinker, a team player, and someone who 
        strives to bring together a distinct array of thinkers and problem solvers to drive through 
        the optimum ‘Security vs Business’ solution.

    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    <h4>LastPass (Formerly GOTO): Nov 2022 - Present</h4>
    <h5>Security Architecture Director</h5>
    <p>Leading an Architecture Team responsible for Cryptography and Identity/AuthN/AuthZ. Current responsibilities encompass 
        the review, modernisation of the Cryptographic Strategy and Architecture across the LassPass 
        Brand. The area of coverage touches multiple disciplines including Zero knowledge, Identity, Key Management, 
        Secrets Management, Data and transport Management.
    </p>

    <h4>Morgan Stanley: Jul 2022 - Nov 2022</h4>
    <h5>Cryptography Security Architect</h5>
    <p>Recognised as a Subject Matter Expert in the Cryptography and PKI domain. Responsibilities include the design 
        and modernisation of Cryptographic processes utilising all forms of crypto mechanisms. The landscape includes 
        both Cloud and On-prem Services and integration points.<br />
        <br />
        Initial Activities:
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a more efficient Revocation mechanism for OCSP ensuring the Server is in the 
            loop (and aware) without losing connectivity.</li>
            <li>Created the Matrix that defines and streamlines the collaboration and process for 
            driving Strategy discussions from Stakeholders through to Roadmap (with other Team members)</li>
            <li>Proposed viable PKI Trust model solutions for Cloud as a Team</li>
            <li>Defined an approach to leverage certain Hardware Security Modules and their ability 
            to meet the Level 3 criteria in certain configurations</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Bank of America / MBNA (merger): 1996 - 2022</h4>
    <h5>Cryptographic Security Architect/Manager (From 2016-July 2021)</h5>
    <p>Manager of the Architecture Cryptography Domain within a Global Organisation. Responsibilities include 
        driving the Global Cryptographic strategy for the Bank both across multiple Vendors and platforms. 
        In many cases this would include crossing numerous and conflicting legislative, and/or Country specific 
        Laws/Requirements that would result in a re-design to achieve a greater security posture across multiple 
        domains. I was integral to providing the solution and design to the major Cloud Service Providers 
        roadmap for enhanced cryptographic solutions to achieve greater isolation for authentication, Network, 
        data, in use, and OS layer security. These solutions have now been extended for the wider Client base 
        (Financial, non-financial, Association) to absorb.<br /><br /> 
        Within my role I have also had the privilege to grow the Team and set them up for success in areas 
        including innovation, design to reality,  collaboration, executive analysis and steer, Policy/Standards 
        compliance as well as driving them to devise and apply collaborative strategies for the application 
        of threat analysis and Cryptographic architecture modelling.
        With other SME Leads, we successfully designed and rolled out individual and multi-faceted reference 
        architectures ensuring solutions have maximum impact.<br /><br />
        Other responsibilities include assisting the Enterprise with up and coming changes in the Industry, 
        such as Protocol enhancements, new initiatives, and how this can enhance or impact the Bank,  
        (examples being TLS 1.3, Quantum, Vulnerabilities, Elliptic Curve implementation concerns).<br /><br />
    
        Selected Milestones<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Designed Single Tenancy Capability for the Major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) enhancing the 
            ability for a greater range of data to be considered for Cloud. All solutions offer a more focussed 
            root of trust.</li>
            <li>Drove the Roadmap for one of the Major CSPs to design Confidential Computing at a hardware 
            level and leverage this to provide attestation trust for Hardware Security Modules.</li>
            <li>Designed the model for an External Vendors to create Key Ownership capability for a Quorum 
            (this solution was also ‘baked’ into the FIPS model by the HSM Vendor).</li> 
            <li>Designed the tiered centralised cryptography solution (Crypto and HSM-as-a-service model) 
            at the bank which services over 100 applications and enabled the Company to be awarded the CSO50 Award.</li>
            <li>Designed the first capability for non standard termination beyond the Load balancer at a Major 
            CSP utilising a 3rd Party HSM offering. This had not been done previously - the CSP leveraged our 
            model for wider utilisation.</li>
            <li>Designed a Key Establishment mechanism for a Major Network Vendor which has now gone into their 
            product offering.</li>
            <li>Design of a bespoke in-cloud application strategy utilising HSMs.</li>
            <li>Was responsible for the re-design of the key storage element within o365.</li>
            <li>Was part of the Team that designed the Threat analysis for Project onboarding that streamlined 
            the partnership between Network, Authentication and Cryptography.</li>
            <li>Leading the Team responsible for industry research, Crypto Model and Ref Architecture Consistency 
            collaborate across both Bank and Service Providers.</li>
        </ul>
